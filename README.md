# Musicschange fullstack project by Kevin Murphy

### Buy and sell used music gear

The live version of this app can be found here: http://peaceful-northcutt-624dc5.netlify.com/

The main goal of this app is make it easy to find someone to buy your music gear, or find new music gear to buy.
I came about this idea by brainstorming how I could link my passion for music/guitars with web development.
I started thinking about how musicians frequently buy and sell gear to suit their needs, and so I came up with this idea.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
* Clear and fluid onboarding page that helps guide UX
* Browsing gear for sale without logging in
* Signup
* Login
* Posting gear ads after logging in
* Editing your ads after logging in
* Removing your ads after logging in
* A clear logout procedure
* Form validation on input of information
* Mobile responsive layout
* Persistance of data
* Effective implementation of user authentication

## Upcoming Features
* Ping the seller button and notifications on account page
* Instant chat
* Sort music gear by type via tabs and/or keyword search
* Mobile app

## How it was built
This app was built using a MERN stack
* Mongo
* Express
* React
* Node

The design is intended to allow for fluid UX and a superb UI while staying simple to highlight app development rather than graphic design.
